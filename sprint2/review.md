# 1. Sprint's backlog

| Task  | Task description                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| T.2.1 | Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building one, encompassing the campus backbone. </br>Integration of every memberâ€™s Packet Tracer simulation into a single simulation. |
| T.2.2 | Development of a layer two and layer three Packet Tracer simulation for building two, encompassing the campus backbone.                                                                                       |

# 2. Subtasks assessment

One by one, each team member presents his/her outcomes to the team, the team assesses the accomplishment of the subtask backlog.
The subtask backlog accomplishment can be assessed as one of:

- Totally implemented with no issues
- Totally implemented with issues
- Partially implemented with no issues
- Partially implemented with issues

For the last three cases, a text description of what has not been implemented and present issues must be added.
Unimplemented features and issues solving is assigned to the same member on the next sprint.
