# 1. Sprint's backlog #

| Task  | Task description                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| T.3.1 | Update the campus.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building 1.                                                                                       |
| T.3.2 | Update the campus.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building 2. Final integration of each member’s Packet Tracer simulation into a single simulation. |


# 2. Technical decisions and coordination #
In this section, all technical decisions taken in the planning meeting should be mentioned. 		Most importantly, all technical decisions impacting on the subtasks implementation must be settled on this 		meeting and specified here.

# 3. Subtasks assignment #
(For each team member (sprint master included), the description of the assigned subtask in sprint 3)

Each task has a code, for example, 3.2.1 means it is a task regarding Sprint 3 for Building 2 and its the task 1.
