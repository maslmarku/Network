RCOMP 2023-2024 Project - Sprint 3 review
=========================================
### Sprint master: 1201958 ###
(This file is to be created/edited by the sprint master only)
# 1. Sprint's backlog #

| T.3.1 | Update the  campus.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building 1.                                                                                       |
| T.3.2 | Update the campus.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building 2. Final integration of each member’s Packet Tracer simulation into a single simulation. |


# 2. Subtasks assessment #
One by one, each team member presents his/her outcomes to the team, the team assesses 		the accomplishment of the subtask backlog.
The subtask backlog accomplishment can be assessed as one of:

  * Totally implemented with no issues
  * Totally implemented with issues
  * Partially implemented with no issues
  * Partially implemented with issues


Each task has a code, for example, 3.2.1 means it is a task regarding Sprint 3 for Building 2 and its the task 1.
